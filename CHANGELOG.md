# 0.5.3

## Fixes

- Add additional global location of rulesets for default installation from PyPI

## Minor

- Run tests in upstream on the Testing Farm via Packit
- Few code-style changes suggested by Sourcery

# 0.5.2

## Fixes

- The global location of rulesests is now correctly found.

# 0.5.1

- Badly done release (version not updated everywhere).
- Replaced by `0.5.2`.

# 0.5.0

## Features

- Result can be converted to xunit xml file. (You can use `--xunit` CLI option to set the file we save the xunit output to.)
- Support for scanning images in OCI format.

## Breaking changes

- Minimal supported version of Python has been raised to 3.6.
- Support for images in ostree format has been removed because Fedora 30 was the latest one
  which had support for ostree in Skopeo. (Replaced by newly added support for OCI format.)

## Minor

- The timeout overwriting now works as expected.

# 0.4.0

## Features

- Create a new check which makes sure that certain labels are overridden in
  layered images.
- Certain remote API calls are now being retried - this should help in environments where network is unreliable.

## Breaking changes

- Python 2 is now completely unsupported.

## Minor

- A bunch of usability issues: when things go wrong, colin should not
  produce more helpful error messages and logs.

# 0.3.1

## Fixes

- Fix metadata checks (ENV, USER) for podman images.
- Fix Fedora packaging. (Conu was temporarily removed from requirements.)
- Documentation updated.

## Breaking changes

- Remove support for Python 2.

# 0.3.0

## New Features

- You can configure timeout for checks now:
  - This can be done via CLI or add `timeout: <seconds>` to a check in a ruleset.
  - Default timeout is set to 10 minutes.
- Checks can be skipped via CLI option `--skip`.

## Breaking changes

- Colin searches a value in label now instead of matching it using a regex.

## Fixes

- Output a sensible error message when the check code cannot be found.
- Handle the situation when the instruction FROM is missing in testing image tag.

# 0.2.1

## New Features

- Allow setting CLI options via environment variables
- Allow loading rulesets from virtualenv
- Add info subcommand

# 0.2.0

## Breaking changes

- switch from docker to podman, thanks to @lachmanfrantisek
- remove `container` target type
- new cli arg: target type (defaults to image -- for podman)

## New Features

- add `ostree` target, thanks to @TomasTomecek
- use fmf format in checks, thanks to @jscotka
- allow rulesets in the YAML format, thanks to @SkullTech

## Fixes

- many code style fixes
- use Centos CI, thanks to @jpopelka
- better loading of the ruleset files (subdir -> user -> system), thanks to @SkullTech
- check existence of json output file directory
- simpler loading of checks
- tinker CONTRIBUTING.md
- do not mount whole FS when checking for files
- improve tests quality

# 0.1.0

Welcome to the first official release of colin. With `0.0.*` releases we tried to iterate on a minimal viable product and with this `0.1.0` release we believe it's finally here.

# Features

- Validate a selected artifact against a ruleset.
- Artifacts can be container images, containers and dockerfiles.
- We provide a default ruleset we believe every container should satisfy.
- There is a ruleset to validate an artifact whether it complies to [Fedora Container Guidelines](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Container:Guidelines)
- Colin can list available rulesets and list checks in a ruleset.
- There is a python API available
- Colin can be integrated into your workflow easily - it can provide results in json format.
