# Features

* Validate a selected artifact against a ruleset.
* Artifacts can be container images, containers and dockerfiles.
* We provide a default ruleset we believe every container should satisfy.
* There is a ruleset to validate an artifact whether it complies to [Fedora Container Guidelines](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Container:Guidelines)
* Colin can list available rulesets and list checks in a ruleset.
* There is a python API available
* Colin can be integrated into your workflow easily - it can provide results in json format.


## Installation


### Via `pip`

If you are on Fedora distribution, please install python3-pyxattr so you don't
have to compile it yourself when getting it from PyPI.

```bash
$ pip3 install --user colin
```


### On Fedora distribution

colin is packaged in official Fedora repositories:
```
$ dnf install -y colin
```

                               default they are placed in

Let's give it a shot:
```
$ colin -f ./rulesets/fedora.json fedora:27
LABELS:
FAIL:Label 'maintainer' has to be specified.
PASS:Label 'name' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'com.redhat.component' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'summary' has to be specified.
PASS:Label 'version' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'usage' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'release' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'architecture' has to be specified.
WARN:Label 'url' has to be specified.
WARN:Label 'help' has to be specified.
WARN:Label 'build-date' has to be specified.
WARN:Label 'distribution-scope' has to be specified.
WARN:Label 'vcs-ref' has to be specified.
...
```

We can also check containers:
```
$ docker run --name some-fedora -d fedora sleep 300
$ colin -f ./rulesets/default.json some-fedora
LABELS:
FAIL:Label 'maintainer' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'name' has to be specified.
...
$ docker run --name my-fedora -l maintainer=myname -d fedora sleep 300
# Adding maintainer name fixes the check:
$ colin -f ./rulesets/default.json  my-fedora
LABELS:
PASS:Label 'maintainer' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'name' has to be specified.
...
```


### Directly from git

It's possible to use colin directly from git:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/user-cont/colin.git
$ cd colin
```

We can now run the analysis:

```
$ python3 -m colin.cli.colin -f ./rulesets/fedora.json fedora:27
FAIL:Label 'architecture' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'build-date' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'description' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'distribution-scope' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'help' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'io.k8s.description' has to be specified.

FAIL:Label 'vcs-ref' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'vcs-type' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'vcs-url' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'com.redhat.component' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'maintainer' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'name' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'release' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'summary' has to be specified.
FAIL:Label 'version' has to be specified.
FAIL:Cmd or Entrypoint has to be specified
